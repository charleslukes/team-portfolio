            <p> Hey there, welcome to my portfolio page and as you have made all the efforts to get here on your own, i am going to reward you by telling you a little story about me... keep reading!
            </p>
            <p>Firstly, let me tell you a little bit about my background and growing up in the      Eastern part of Nigeria. 
                I hail from Enugu State but was born and brought up Onitsha where i attended my basic education, went to a boarding secondary school in Enugu and attended Uniport in Rivers State where i obtained my degree in Religious and Cultural Studies with a second upper honours.
            </p>

            <p>
                I came from a family of eight boys...yeah,you heard that right... eight boys! No girls. I know most people find that weird but i see that as one onf the most unique blessings of my life and family and we are all well raised on how to love and respect women. How one man and one woman almost gave birth to a full football team is mind-boggling, talk about men who is fulfilling one of most the essential purposes for God's creation of man, my dad is definitely not missing out...lol
            </p>

            <p>life in the East was fun and challenging at the same time because we have always been accustomed to this culture of hardworking and hustling to make out your way and even when you are still a child the pressure is already on you and then there were no margin for errors because your community are already comparing you with the hottest kid on the block who just bought his mother a Benz or that whiz who just won a scholarship to go study in America. It is always kind of more fast paced than anywhere else i have ever been in Nigeria apart from Lagos... Lagos and everyone living in it are mad.</p>

            <p>But i didn't have that kind of experience because i had the most kind of parents who were very liberal and allowed us to flourish and freely become whomever we wished to be but encouraged us to always work harder that we can achieve anything we put our minds to. Infact, sometimes i think one of my biggest problems with them was making us so humble and respectful... i didn't like the fact that i didn't grow to be radical...*frowns face*</p>

            <p>Growing up back then, in school and around my environment, from many people that have been around me, i have received, answered and have been given so many names because of my behaviour. Most people say that i am very funny and that i behave in a funny way, and have even jokingly called me a BIG FOOL and sincerely i still cannot help it till today... eez eet your MuMu?...lol. Most
             have suggested even until this day that i should go and become a comedian or a comical actor. One lady even told me recently that i am in the wrong profession, after laughing so hard at one of my conversations.</p>

             <p>
                 Personally, i really considered all their suggestions and wanted to become a clown, a comical actor or a stand up comedian but like the story about my background which i earlier told you had a role to play in changing that dream especially in Nigeria where it is only a thin line taht differentiates you from a mad man when your a poor comedian... Hahaha! I si na-akuko ka i ga-e ji buro mmadu n'uwa i putara?
             </p>

             <p> So those factors led me to where i am today, to my journey into software development... My Guy Na condition make Cray-fish bend... no be correct eye!

            I will tell you more about how my software development journey began if you let me know whether you enjoyed this one....See you! Bye!
